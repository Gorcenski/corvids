# CORVIDS

This is the code for the data reconstruction tool CORVIDS.

We recommend downloading the stand-alone version of the software, found in the [latest release](https://github.com/katherinemwood/corvids/releases). We have a standalone for Mac and Windows.

For help, check out the documentation or [this blog post](https://katherinemwood.github.io/post/corvids) to see how things work. For implementation details, please see the accompanying paper on PsyArXiv:
