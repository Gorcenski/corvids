# CORVIDS

This is the code for the data reconstruction tool CORVIDS.

We recommend downloading the stand-alone version of the software. We currently have a Mac standalone, with Windows on the way.

For help, check out the documentation or [this blog post](katherinemwood.github.io/post/corvids) to see how things work. For implementation details, please see the accompanying paper on PsyArXiv:
